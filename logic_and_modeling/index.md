In Spring 2020 I taught Logic and Modeling, a second-year undergraduate course in theoretical computer science, at the VU.
Due to COVID-19, the course was entirely online.
Lectures were pre-recorded in 10 minute video clips.
For each lecture, I hosted a live Q&A session via video meeting.
Exercise classes were also held live by the course teaching assistants, 
Geoffrey Frankhuizen and Katrin Obendrauf.

For archival purposes, I have collected here the lectures and the recordings of live sessions.

## Syllabus

The official (pre-COVID) syllabus is available [here](../files/syllabus.pdf).

Briefly, Logic and Modeling is an introduction to different logical languages
as tools for specification and verification.
The course covers syntax, semantics, and derivations in propositional and first order logic;
syntax and Kripke semantics of modal logic;
metatheorems of the different logics, including soundness, completeness, and (un)decidability;
and the structure of informal mathematical proofs.

The pen-and-paper presentations of propositional and first order logic are supplemented 
by the use of Lean, a tool that can check logical proofs automatically.
Lean and similar systems are used "in the wild" for software verification,
giving the course a practical component. 

The first nine lectures, through propositional logic, follow the text
[Logic and Proof](http://avigad.github.io/logic_and_proof/), which I have written with 
Jeremy Avigad and Floris van Doorn.
The remaining lectures, on modal logic and metatheorems, follow Huth and Ryan's
[Logic in Computer Science](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/lics/).

Course materials were distributed over Canvas. I have archived a few relevant pages here for public consumption.

## Lectures

Unfortunately the Kaltura interface makes it somewhat inconvenient to publicize these videos.
I have collected the videos for each lecture on one single page.
Some mobile platforms do not display them with full features: 
you should be able to choose between seeing my screen, my face, or either embedded in the other.

## Q&A Sessions

At each scheduled lecture time, I hosted a live [Q&A session](qa.html).
