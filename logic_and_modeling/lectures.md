## Lecture 1: Chapters 1 and 2 of Logic and Proof, beginning Chapter 3

Brief repetition of syntax of propositional logic: L&P 2.4

Note: This is a repetition of concepts that you should know already from the course Logic and Sets.

Deduction rules for propositional logic, and how they relate to informal reasoning: L&P 2.1, 2.2, 2.3.1-2.3.3

Natural deduction proofs using and and implies: 3.1

## Lecture 2: Chapters 3 and 5 of Logic and Proof

... continuation natural deduction for propositional logic

rules for negation

rules for disjunction

proof by contradiction (PBC)

Strategy for creating natural deduction proofs

L&P 2.3, 3.1-3.4

## Lecture 3: Chapter 4 of Logic and Proof

Propositional logic in Lean.

L&P 4.1-4.4. Look at 4.6, but we won't discuss in lecture.
 

## Lecture 4: Chapters 5 and 6 of Logic and Proof

Semantics of propositional logic.

Soundness and completeness theorems

Classical reasoning.

All sections of ch. 5 and 6. (Note that some of ch. 6 is review from Logic and Sets.)

## Lecture 5: Chapters 7 and 8 of Logic and Proof:

Syntax of predicate (first order) logic

terms, forumlas, and parse trees

scope of a quantor

bound and free variables

substitution

## Lecture 6: Chapters 8 and 9

Continuation natural deduction for predicate logic

Predicate logic in Lean

Predicate logic with equality

L&P 7.5, 8.4-8.5, 9.1-9.4
 

## Lecture 7: Chapter 10

Semantics of predicate logic

models

interpretation of formulas

simplified (without free variables and quantifiers)

environments for dealing with free variables

full truth definition

associated notions

semantic entailment

L&P 10.1-10.4. 
 

## Lecture 8:

Semantics, associated notions:

logical equivalence

satisfiability of formulas

validity of formulas

consistency, inconsistency of sets of formulas

Translating into predicate logic

Interplay between connectives and quantifiers
