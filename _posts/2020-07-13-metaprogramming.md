Johan Commelin and Patrick Massot are organizing the workshop 
[Lean for the Curious Mathematician](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lftcm2020/),
taking place virtually July 13-17, 2020.
The workshop aims to give working mathematicians
a hands-on introduction to formal proof.

As part of the "intermediate track" of this workshop,
for users who have some experience with formal proof,
I recorded a [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlF-CfQhukNnq2kDCw2P_vI5AfXN7egP2)
about metaprogramming in Lean:
how do we use the system to introspect on its own syntax
and write and evaluate programs to prove theorems? 

Since the workshop is aimed at a novice audience,
I wasn't expecting a large live audience,
so I prerecorded the videos and put them on YouTube. 
The first two videos in the series are accessible to people 
who have had any introduction to Lean, for instance through the [Natural Number Game](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/).
The later videos assume some more familiarity with the system 
and with functional programming.

Feedback on these recordings is very welcome!
