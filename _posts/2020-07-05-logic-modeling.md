In Spring 2020, I taught the course Logic and Modeling at the VU.
The course was held entirely online due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

I have collected the course information, lecture recordings, and assignments
[here]({{site.url}}/logic_and_modeling).
(While the archive does not contain all the information that was on Canvas,
it contains most of the material fit for public consumption.)

Instructors interested in teaching with the [Logic and Proof](http://avigad.github.io/logic_and_proof/) text
may find the recorded lectures of some use!
