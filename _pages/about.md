Hi, I'm Robert Y. Lewis. I'm a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at Brown University. My interests revolve around formal methods and verification, logic, and the foundations of mathematics, and the use of these in computer science and mathematics education. I work on interactive theorem proving, automated reasoning, and type theory. You can read [many more details here](/research/).

Before coming to Brown I was a postdoc at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Before that, I got my PhD in Pure and Applied Logic at Carnegie Mellon University. Way back in the day I taught high school math at St. Agnes Academy in Houston.
